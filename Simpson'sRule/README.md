Algorithm is a numerical evaluation of an integral by Simpson's 1/3 rule. Acceptes a vector a x values and a vector of y values that are equally 
spaced. Returns I, the calculated numerical integral.

Syntax: simpsonsRule(x,y)

Example:
> x = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
> y = [12, 23, 45, 67]
>
> simpsonsRule(x, y)
